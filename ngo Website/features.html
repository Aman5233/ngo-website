<h2><span style="color: blue;">C</span> Networking</h2>
<p>Networking with NGO leaders can be an invaluable resource for advancing the mission of an organization, finding resources, establishing partnerships, and promoting professional and personal development. WANGO provides a unique forum for networking among key leaders of diverse and influential NGOs, as well as affiliated intergovernmental and governmental bodies, universities, and businesses.

  The Association fosters dialogue between grantmakers and grantseekers, facilitating the grantmaking process and making it more comprehensive and effective. Corporations and governmental bodies may seek to form partnerships with NGOs, and corporations may desire to improve employee morale and retention by involving them in NGO service in various parts of the world.
  
  In addition, members in various nations develop their own national WANGO chapters, which can focus on issues of specific interests to the membership in those areas. WANGO's neural network, conferences, and the Sharing Resources section facilitate networking, and WANGO's Worldwide NGO Directory and Membership List are valuable resources for both networking and partnering among NGOs.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: blue;">E</span> Code of Ethics and Conduc</h2>
  <p>As part of the Association's effort to strengthen and improve the non-governmental sector as whole, WANGO spearheaded the development of a Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs. Formulated by an international committee representing the wide spectrum of the NGO community, including input from NGO leaders from over 100 nations, the present Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs identifies 7 fundamental principles and over 100 specific standards to guide the actions and management of NGOs worldwide. Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs is provided free of charge to WANGO members.

    Affiliate Members can gain an assessment of the legitimacy of an NGO by recognizing that NGO applicants for WANGO membership go through a rigorous process. Self-assessment also provides some measure. WANGO NGO members may certify that they adhere to the Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs. Organizations that self-certify that they meet the standards in the Code, and accept responsibility for following the standards, may note this fact in their promotional literature. Organizations that self-certify that they meet the Code may be removed from WANGO membership if it is shown they fall short of the standards.</p>
